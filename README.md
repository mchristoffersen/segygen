# segygen
Python SEG-Y Generator

## Notes
This program will only work with data from the "USRDR" Shallow Radar (SHARAD) dataset in NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) [1]. It converts a binary radargram file (the .img files) and its accompanying geometry file (.tab files) to a SEG-Y file containing the radargram and per-trace geometry data. It will optionally take a left/right surface clutter simulation file, combine the simulations, and output a SEG-Y file containing a combined clutter simulation and per-trace geometry data. 

## Files

**makesegy.py** - Program to create SEG-Y formatted files from USRDR SHARAD data on the PDS, the command line interface is documented below  
**segydump.py** - (Incomplete) program to dump the header of a SEG-Y formatted file to the terminal  
**sharad.kwd** - Keyword file for use with Seisware to ingest SEG-Y files generated by this program

## makesegy.py CLI
<pre>
usage: makesegy.py [-h] [--sim sim] [--out out] rgram geom

Build a SEG-Y revision 2.0 formatted file from SHARAD USRDR PDS data and one
from the accompanying surface clutter simulation, if supplied.

positional arguments:  
  rgram              USRDR radargram (.img) file  
  geom               USRDR geometry (.tab) file  

optional arguments:  
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit  
  --sim sim, -s sim  PDS sim (sim_lr.img) file  
  --out out, -o out  Output directory (default: ./)
</pre>
